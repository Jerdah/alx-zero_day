My first readme
For Git tasks;
- Branching is creating a copy of your project for the purpose of:
      - Collaboration with other developers
      - Adding a feature in your development
      - You can use a branch if you do not want to break your entire repository
- To create a branch we use git branch "name_of_branch"
- Then we use git checkout "name_of_branch"
- To push any new changes for this branch we use git push --set-upstream origin update_script
- To go back to the main branch we use git checkout master
